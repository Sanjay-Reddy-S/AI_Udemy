#Self-driving cars

Need to install [Kivy](https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html) Python library to create the map on the screen.

The map.py takes care of the GUI elements. The ai.py is the main brain behind the car. 
Draw lines of sand on the map and see how the car navigates the map. 

The goal of the car is to make trips continuously from the upper-left of the map to the bottom-right.
